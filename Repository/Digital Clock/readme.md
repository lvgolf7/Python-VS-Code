# Seven Segment Clock Display
This is a seven segment digital clock display.  This uses the sevseg.py function, which is included in this folder.  This must be in the same directory as the program to run.
Uses error traps to catch if sevseg.py is available.  

Will clear the screen on Windows, Mac and Linux.
